# d3_second_repository_Part_2
My third repository consists on a tool I have developed in HTML (Visual Studio 2019).

This tool allows the user to visualize a data table from a .csv file that the own user chooses.
*I have only managed to obtain these data loadings, but without extracting columns and their corresponding means.
